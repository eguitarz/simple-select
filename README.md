simple-select
=============

An html select input which is simple and css custumization supported.

why this?
=========
The select object in different browsers has different looks. And you can not modify its css. I want to present a delicate select, so I made this.

use
===
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/simple-select.css">
<script src="simple-select.js"></script>
```
